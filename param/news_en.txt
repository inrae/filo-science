===========
Version 1.7.0 of 2020-08-07
---------------------------
What's New :
- addition of information to the fish to specify the conditions of capture, anaesthesia, release, etc.
- addition of a field dedicated to "spaghetti" mark for fishes
- it is possible to assign a business code to a station
- fishing sequences can be given a name
- if fish have been entered only in the telemetry module, it is now possible to link them to a fishing sequence at a later date.
- in importing detections (telemetry module), it is possible to use a file containing all antennas (previously, import was done antenna by antenna). It is also possible to activate an "overwrite" mode, which will rewrite the already imported detections without duplicating them.

Bug fixes :
- in the telemetry module, on the fish movement map, the information of the stations displayed when the mouse is hovering was not clear.
- in some cases, changing the password may not be successful.
- in the SQL query module, the export of results in CSV format did not work properly

Version 1.6.0 of 2020-05-25
---------------------------
News :
Telemetry module :
- it's now possible to import fish from a CSV file
- the display of the list of tracked fishes has been revised, with a switch to a tab box
- the description of the models for importing remote sensing or probe analysis has been reviewed
- it is now possible to enter a business code for a fish. This code can be used to retrieve it when importing remote detections.
Fishing module :
- all the parameter tables can receive a business code
- it is now possible to duplicate a sequence
- it is possible to define specific measures to describe the environments (same operation as for complementary fish measurements or water analyses)

Bug fixes :
- when entering additional information, multiple choice lists were not saved.
- The procedure for exporting the database structure has been corrected.
- the term "remote sensing" has been replaced by "Telemetry".
- the modification of a location was not successful
- some English translations were not done
- when modifying a fish, the acoustic transmitter code was not displayed.

Version 1.5.0 of 2020-04-14
---------------------------
News:
- it is now possible to inhibit the manual entry of the taxon when it does not exist in the database (parameter of the protocol)
- when importing CSV files containing the detections, it is possible to define one or more header lines not to be processed
- it is now possible to export all detections of all (selected) fishes of a tracking campaign
- Users with param permission can create and execute SQL queries directly in the database.

Version 1.4.0 of 2019-12-17
---------------------------
News:
- addition of the table sequence_point, to manage inventories by collection points
- addition of the geom attribute on the operation and ambience tables to facilitate cartographic representation with third party software
- a business code can be indicated for an installed machine
- it is now possible to duplicate an operation, at least the general information
- the last processed campaign can now be recalled from the menu
- in the detail of an operation, the location of the sequences is displayed on a map

Bug fixes:
- entering the total weight of a sample did not support decimals
- the display of the database table structure has been improved to facilitate its reading
- importing files in Json format failed in some cases

Release 1.3.0 of 2019-11-18
---------------------------
News:
- integration of the radiotracking management module: fish monitoring, definition of listening stations or physico-chemical analysis, field entry from QField (Android component for Qgis), display of movements on a map
- integration of modules allowing the import of probe data or listening stations and data exchange between two databases
- addition of the UUID to safely identify the different records managed by the fishing module
- caching of OpenStreetMap tiles to be able to work in offline mode

Release 1.2.0 of 2019-08-29
---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- it was not possible to enter the total weight of the batch
- the map display now works without resizing the window

News :
- the batch number is now displayed when entering fish
- when there is a taxon change, an alert signal is displayed
- the tabs are displayed when hovering (a click on a tab disables this mechanism). The last tab used is displayed by default
- it is possible to add parts to a project, protocol or operation
- it is possible to define a grid of buttons, which allows to quickly select the most frequent taxa
- it is possible to define specific analyses associated with a protocol
- it is possible to define complementary measures for a taxon, associated with a protocol
- campaigns are now systematically displayed in relation to the first project in the list. Projects can be positioned "inactive" to avoid viewing them during the search
- when capturing fish, the overflight of the current measurement fields allows to define the focus
- to allow automatic size entry from calipers, the + sign is systematically removed
- the entry by caliper leading by default to the validation of the current sheet and the creation of a new fish sheet, a button deactivates this automatic call. You must then click on the validation buttons to save the information
- upgrading the framework to integrate current security requirements


Release 1.1.0 of 2019-06-05
---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- in some cases, navigation was not carried out correctly, especially for returns to previous pages
- connection feedback with empty identifiers was poorly managed

News:
- added operator entry
- added entry of water analyses (standard parameters)
- writing administration documentation

Release v1.0.1 of 2019-05-14
------------
Bug fixes:
- the transformation of the identifiers did not work in certain cases, resulting in the impossibility of seizing the gear attached to a sequence
- the display of the minimum measured size of a lot did not work
- corrections of the installation script

News:
- display of structure of the database (admin access)

Release v1.0
------------
First production version of the application. It does not understand :
- seizure of other measurements (ocular diameters, p. e.)
- seizure of chemical analyzes of water
- typing in tablet mode
- fish length controls
- the translation of the labels in English
- the recording of operators
